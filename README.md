## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM metodology


### What I learned
One of the most important things I've learned is the importance of writing readme.

Other concepts have been the use of the BEM methodology to be able to guide myself through the CSS, I'm still a bit green and I create more code than necessary, I hope to polish this aspect.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.



### Continued development

Some of the technologies and concepts that I am currently interested in improving include: Semantic HTML and more optimized CSS. Gradually, I would also like to improve my knowledge in library types like Bootstrap, and practice CSS methodologies like BEM.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank [@Hassiai] (https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Hassiai) for correcting my previous exercise and helping me better assimilate the concepts. I would also like to thank the people who believe in me and support me every day. Special mention to Angela Garcia [@Angela-GM] (https://github.com/Angela-GM), my wife, with whom I try to compete every day to improve. I would also like to thank [@openbootcamp] (https://open-bootcamp.com/) for their daily effort to bring "free" content to the platform and try to improve the community.

*I would also like to add that Open-bootcamp is an incredible and free platform with a great community. However, currently, due to the bubble in the industry, they have opened a donation line through GitHub. It would be a shame for this platform that can be so helpful to disappear, so if you want to support it, please consider making a donation (https://github.com/sponsors/Open-Bootcamp)
